# GraphColoring
One Mathematical Model is described here for the Graph Coloring Problem which is basically coloring the nodes in the graph with minimum color such that for each edge the connecting nodes have different color. \
Given a input format like: \
4 3 \
0 1 \
1 2 \
1 3 \
Here the first line gives the number of nodes and edges, the corresponding lines gives the details of the edges where the node is sequenced from 0. \
We have the following IP model: \
Variables: 
$color_{i}: Non-neagative integer, the color (represented by number) of a node i$
